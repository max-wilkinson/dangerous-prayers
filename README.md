# Dangerous Prayers (Excerpt)
## By Craig Groeschel

“Hey, Craig, do you believe God still does miracles?” 

“Of course,” I said. 

“Good—because your prayers are so lame.” 

My buddy knew me well enough to tease me, but I suspect he was also making a point. Left speechless, I offered no defense as I processed the truth of his observation. I couldn’t deny that he voiced a secret I already knew but didn’t want to admit: my prayers were pathetic. 

As I studied the Bible more, I marveled at the variety of prayers spoken by God’s people. Not only did they pray about things that were incredibly personal—to conceive a child, for instance (1 Sam. 1:27)—but also their prayers were often so practical, for food and provision (Matt. 6:11) and escape from their enemies (Ps. 59:1–2). Sometimes they seemed to gently whisper to a loving God. Other times they yelled at him in agony and frustration. 

They often pleaded with God sincerely. Then later they’d cry out from the depths of their anguish and rail at God like a tired toddler thrashing in the arms of a parent. They prayed for boldness to share their faith. They prayed for walls, both internally and externally, to fall. Daniel prayed for the mouths of hungry lions to be shut, and Jonah prayed for the belly of a hungry whale to be opened. Gideon prayed for his fleece to be wet one day and dry another. God’s people prayed whether they were giddy with joy or crushed by sorrow. 

Their prayers were honest. Desperate. Fiery. Gutsy. Real. 

And there I was praying that God would keep me safe and bless my burger and fries. 

My friend was right. 

My prayers were lame. 

Prayer is sacred communication, the language of longing, a divine dialogue between you and your heavenly Father, your Abba, your Daddy. When you pray, the God of the universe listens. And not only does he listen, but he also cares. About what you have to say. About all the things you carry around in your heart that no one else knows about. Maybe even some things you don’t know about. God wants to hear you and speak to you. He wants to communicate with you the same way you sit across from a loved one and enjoy an intimate conversation. 

Your prayers matter. 

How you pray matters. 

What you pray matters. 

Your. Prayers. Move. God.  

We’re told in the Bible that we can “come boldly to the throne of our gracious God” (Heb. 4:16a NLT). We don’t have to approach timidly or feel awkward—we can come before him with confidence, assurance, and boldness. When we pray this way, then “we will receive his mercy, and we will find grace to help us when we need it most” (Heb. 4:16b NLT). 

These prayers require faith. Courage. They ask you to risk. 

Instead of just checking a box, your prayers might actually change eternity, shaking hell, scaring demons, and enlarging heaven. 

Your prayers become dangerous. 

Sound extreme? I promise you it’s not. More importantly, God promises. If you call out to him, God assures you that he hears the cries of your heart.
